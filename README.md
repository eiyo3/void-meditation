## What is VOID?

VOID is a browser-based meditation app that generates audio and visuals in real time. Unlike apps that play pre-recorded tracks, VOID creates a unique soundscape every session using the Web Audio API.

## Features

- **Real-time audio synthesis** — Ambient, Minimal, Ethnic, Dark, and Dream music styles generated on the fly
- **Binaural beats** — Science-backed frequencies (40Hz Gamma, 7.83Hz Schumann, 6Hz Theta, 2Hz Delta)
- **Interactive generative visuals** — 4 modes (Kaleidoscope, Fractal, Wave, Void) that respond to your mouse
- **Breathing guide** — 4-4-6 pattern (inhale-hold-exhale) for deep relaxation
- **Session tracking** — Timer, streak count, and meditation statistics
- **Multilingual** — English / Japanese
- **Zero install** — Runs entirely in your browser
